[b]CrypTool 2.1 Beta 1[b]

Dear CrypTool 2.1 users.

Many new components found their way into this new beta release.
For a detailed overview of new components please use the list beneath this text. We hope you have as much fun 
using CrypTool 2.1 Beta 1 as we had creating it. If you find any bugs please do not hesitate using our bug 
reporting form at https://www.cryptool.org/trac/CrypTool2/newticket or use the contact form on the upper 
right side under the "About" menu in the CrypTool 2.0 application.

We changed the version number from 2.0 to 2.1 since we are now working on the successor of the CrypTool 2.0 release version.

Sincerly yours,
The CrypTool 2.1 Developer Team, July 2016

CrypCloud:
We implemented the first version of the CrypCloud. The CrypCloud enables users to connect to a decentralized cloud network to 
work on distributed cryptanalysis combinging several instances of CrypTool 2. CrypTool 2.1 users may create a user certificate 
using the cloud login to participate in the CrypCloud. Right now, only distributed brute-force attacks on symmetric cipers are 
possible using the Keysearcher component, which is now compatible to the CrypCloud. Users are able to upload, download, and work 
on distributed jobs.
