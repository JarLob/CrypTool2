[b]CrypTool 2 Release 2019.1[b]

Dear CrypTool 2 users.

CrypTool 2 (CT2) is free, open-source e-learning software about cryptography and cryptanalysis used in schools, universities, companies, and administrations all over the world.

In June 2019, we published the first release of CrypTool 2 this year, named "2019.1". Compared to release "2018.3", three main parts were added:

The first main part of this update is the change from the x86 architecture (32bit) to the x64 architecture (64bit). 
This allows CT2 to allocate more memory, thus, makes the integration of more sophisticated cryptanalysis components possible.

The second main part is the introduction of the CrypToolStore. 
The store allows external developers to easily develop and integrate their components into CT2.
Such components, which are not (yet) part of the official CT2 installation, can be downloaded and installed by the user through the store. 
The store also allows us to publish components in shorter time frames than ever before or to test intermediate results from students more easily.
Besides downloading components, the store also allows to download "external files", e.g. huge language statistics.

The third part published within this release is the CrypCloud. 
The cloud allows the distributed cryptanalysis of modern symmetric ciphers like DES or AES. 
Multiple computers can be connected through the cloud to attack these ciphers using the built-in KeySearcher (brute-force or exhaustive search).
This demonstrates how distributed cryptanalysis can easily be parallelized on multiple computers of ad-hoc volunteering networks.

Also, we integrated the new "Homophonic Substitution Analyzer" component. 
Right now, the analyzer allows to efficiently break homophonic encrypted English texts. 
In future releases, we'll integrate more target languages.

Sincerely yours,
The CrypTool 2 Developer Team, June 2019


Changelog summary:

New and updated components:
- DECODE database tools: We added authentication to the DECODE database tools, allowing, to download restricted documents (login credentials needed).
- CrypToolStore: We added the CrypToolStore: a "store" allowing to download components and files from external developers.
- CrypCloud: We added the CrypCloud: a peer-to-peer-based distributed computing platform for distributed cryptanalysis.
- Homophonic Substitution Analyzer: an analyzer that allows the automatic and semi-automatic cryptanalysis of homophonic ciphers
-- Zodiac-408: as an example for homophonic substitution analysis, we added the (in-)famous Zodiac-408 letter, which is homophonically encrypted and can be solved automatically by CT2 now.

And:
Many small bugs fixed ...
Many typos corrected ...
