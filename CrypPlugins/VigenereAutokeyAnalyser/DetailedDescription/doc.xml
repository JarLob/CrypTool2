    The Vigenere Autokey Analyser is used for a ciphertext-only attack on <docRef item="Vigenere"/> or autokey ciphers.
    For more information on the autokey cipher have a look at <ref id="autokey"/>

    As seen above the component contains of three inputs and one output. The output will deliver the most probable keyword your text was encrypted with. The component uses "the sum of least squares" method to find the most probable key letters for each column of the cipher. To calculate the key only a ciphertext and a guess about the language is required. The component consists of three inputs. <newline/>

    <section headline="Configuring the component">
      The first input requires the ciphertext that needs to be analysed, however the other two inputs are optional. You can either give a text corpus to the second input, so that the component can refer to a language you assume the plaintext to be, or supplied an assumed key length that the analyser should work with. Instead of using these two optional inputs you can just select a language in the taskpane on the right side of your cryptool window:

      <newline/>
      Just select the language you assume the original plaintext to be. Also don't forget to select between the two modes of the analyser whether you try to break an autokey or a classic vigenere cipher. The alphabet represents all characters the plaintext was most likely shifted with. Normally you don't need to change those characters.

    <section headline="Using the component">
      After setting up the task pane options and the cipher input you can start the process.

      The quickwatch as seen above will now represent all calculated keys if there was no key length given. If the third input was set, there will only one possible key be seen in here. You can now select one of the keys by double clicking them. The grey key is the most probable one as it gains the highest IC for all possible plaintexts. If your cipher wasn't encoded correct, try to use another language frequency or use your own text corpus to help with the analysis. <newline/>
      This component will try out all possible key length up until 1/40 of your ciphertext length if there is no key length set at the third input. To find a most probable key length, use the <docRef item="Autocorrelation"/> component on your ciphertext and connect its output with the third input of this component.
