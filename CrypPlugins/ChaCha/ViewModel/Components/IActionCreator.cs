    /// Since we are using a centralized navigation system, we need to define the complete page state in every action.
    /// This interface documents and defines helper methods for a high-level action creation API.
    ///
    /// The basic idea behind it is to define "sequences" of actions.
    /// For example, consider this code:
    /// <code>
    ///   > ActionCreator ac = new ActionCreator(); <br/>
    ///   > ac.StartSequence(); <br/>
    ///   > var a1 = ac.CreateAction(() => Console.WriteLine("a1")); <br/>
    ///   > var b1 = ac.CreateAction(() => Console.WriteLine("b1")); <br/>
    ///   > ac.StartSequence(); <br/>
    ///   > var a2 = ac.CreateAction(() => Console.WriteLine("a2")); <br/>
    ///   > var b2 = ac.CreateAction(() => Console.WriteLine("b2")); <br/>
    ///   > ac.EndSequence(); <br/>
    ///   > var d1 = ac.CreateAction(() => Console.WriteLine("c1")); <br/>
    ///   > ac.EndSequence(); <br/>
    ///   > a1(); b1(); a2(); b2(); c2(); <br/>
    /// </code>
    /// <br/>
    /// This will output:
    /// <code>
    ///   > a1 <br/>
    ///   > a1 b1 <br/>
    ///   > a1 b1 a2 <br/>
    ///   > a1 b1 a2 b2 <br/>
    ///   > a1 b1 c1 <br/>
    /// </code>
    /// <br/>
    /// As we can see, when we start a sequence all following actions will contain all previous actions from all sequences and we can nest sequences inside other sequences.
    /// This works by a concept which I called "extending". If Action A extends Action b, this means that Action A contains all statements from Action b or in other words, A is a superset of b.
