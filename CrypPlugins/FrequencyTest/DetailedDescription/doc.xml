    Frequency analysis reveals statistical information about the plaintext, which can be used as an aid or as a breaking tool itself (in case of monoalphabetical ciphers).<newline/>
    <newline/>
    A monoalphabetic cipher is especially vulnerable to frequency analysis. Frequency analysis is simple count of the reoccurring letters in the ciphertext and comparing it to previously calculated frequency of occurrences in a given language.
    Here is an example of how a monoalphabetic cipher (in our case Caesar’s cipher) can be broken with the help of frequency analysis:<newline/>

    <newline/>
    From the picture it is easy to see that the patterns are the same although the texts are different which could be expected for any writing (in English or any other language). Moreover we could say that the pattern of the ciphertext (in this case)
    is shifted exactly three positions to the right. Replacing each character in the ciphertext with the character three positions to the left, considering the order of the alphabet, one could easily decipher the text.<newline/>
    <newline/>
    Such an exploration gives us very little information for polyalphabetically enciphered message. Polyalphabetic ciphers disguise the frequencies of the characters which makes the cipher immune to frequency analysis alone and therefore
    other methods should be also used.

  <usage lang="en">
    In cryptanalysis, frequency analysis is the study of the frequency of letters or groups of letters in a ciphertext. The method is used as an aid to breaking classical ciphers. The method of frequency analysis is implemented in the component
    described below. The component takes a single input from string type and yields string and integer array outputs. This means that any other component with string output can be used as input source for Frequency Test. The string output of
    Frequency Test shows statistical information about each character counted, number of occurrences and percentage from the entire text. The integer array output (black triangle) gives information only about the character counts and is used
    exclusively from Friedman Test component for key length proposition of Vigenère ciphertext.<newline/>
    <newline/>
    As depicted below we use Text Input and Text Output in connection with Frequency Test:<newline/>

    The gram length option gives the possibility to count and output statistical data for groups of characters with the selected size. The default value is: 1. Non alphabetic characters option is proposing the possibilities to consider or not
    the characters which are not in the English alphabet. The default value is: Don’t count. Case sensitivity option gives the choice if the uppercase and lowercase letters should be considered equal or not. Default value is: Case insensitive.
