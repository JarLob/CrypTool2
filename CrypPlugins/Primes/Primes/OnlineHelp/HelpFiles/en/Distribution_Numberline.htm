<h2>Distribution of prime numbers on the number line</h2>
<p align="justify">
Euclid's theorem proves that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Their properties have been studied by mathematicians for thousands of years and still no one has discovered whether there is a pattern to the way in which the primes are distributed among the natural numbers - let alone to define such a distribution. 
<br /> <br />
This dialog shows the natural numbers &gt;= 2.  Every prime number is a pale blue dot; composite numbers are black dots.
The size of the indicated range of natural numbers may be adjusted using the "+" and "-" controls.  The "arrow" buttons at the top of the screen may be used to adjust the number line. If you move the mouse cursor over a number, the following information is displayed for that number:<br />
<ul>
<li>The next smaller and next larger prime numbers</li>
<li>The <a href="help://Graph_PiX">actual number of primes</a> in the range indicated and the number of 
prime numbers according to the <a href="help://Graph_GaussPi">prime number theorem</a> of Gauss</li>
<li>The <a href="help://Factorization_Factorization">prime factorization of the number</a></li>
<li>The calculation of <a href="help://Distribution_Goldbach">Goldbach's conjecture</a></li>
<li>The next larger and next smaller <a href="help://Distribution_TwinPrimes">twin primes</a></li>
<li>Information about <a href="help://Distribution_QuadrupletPrimes">Prime Quadruplets</a> and <a href="help://Distribution_SixTupletPrimes">Sixtuplet Primes</a>.</li>
</ul>

In addition, the following functions are calculated using the theory of numbers and have great significance in many mathematical areas, especially in modern cryptographic algorithms such as those requiring RSA - length Prime numbers to serve as keys:
<ul>
<li><a href="help://Distribution_EulerPhi">Euler's Phi-function</a></li>
<li>The <a href="help://Distribution_Tau">number of divisors of the number</a></li>
<li>The <a href="help://Distribution_Rho">The sum of divisors function</a></li>
<li>The <a href="help://Distribution_EulerPhiSum">The sum of divisors function</a></li>
