<h2>Twin primes</h2>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime" target=_blank">twin prime</a> is a pair of prime numbers with the smaller prime separated by 2 from the larger. The first twin primes are <i>(3,5)</i>, <i>(5,7)</i>, and <i>(11,13)</i>.
It is still not known whether there are infinitely many twin primes. This question is one of the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics" target=_blank">unsolved problems of mathematics</a>.
 <br /><br />
The question of whether there are infinitely many twin primes is equivalent to the question of whether the system of equations
<br />
&phi; (n) = n-1<br />
&phi; (n+2) = n+1<br />
has infinitely many solutions.
