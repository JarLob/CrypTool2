<h2>Number of divisors</h2>

The Tau function indicates the number of divisors a natural number n has. The divisors 1 and n, factors for any integer, are taken into account, so that prime numbers will have exactly two factors. The function is denoted by the Greek letter &tau;.<br />
<br />
It is defined in the following way:<br />

It holds that &tau; (p) = 2 for all primes.
Relation to the &phi;-function: &tau; (n) + &phi; (n) = n + 1 for all n in N.
