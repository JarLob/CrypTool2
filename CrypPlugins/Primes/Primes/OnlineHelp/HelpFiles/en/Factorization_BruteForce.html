<h2>Factoring by trial division</h2>

Trial division is a very intuitive method of factorization. It begins by dividing the number by 2.
If the number is divisible by 2 without remainder, then divide the result by 2 again.
The process is continued in this manner until the result is no longer divisible without remainder by 2.
The next step is to divide by 3 in a similar manner until the result of the division is no longer divisible by 3, and so on.
Continue using the next number, until finally the result of the division is a prime number.

While this process works, it is the least efficient, and takes longest to complete.
The factorization of a number with two very large prime factors, such as those used in the RSA process, would take very long.
At this time, we utilize 300-digit decimal numbers, or larger. To utilize Trial Division to attempt the factoring of such a large
number would take longer than the age of the universe.
