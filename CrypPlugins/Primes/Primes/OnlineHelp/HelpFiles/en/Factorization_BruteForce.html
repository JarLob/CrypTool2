<h2>Factorization by Trial Division [Brute-force Method]</h2>

Trial division is a very intuitive method of factorization.
One begins by dividing the number to be factored by 2. If the number is divisible by 2 without remainder, [known as dividing evenly], we then divide the result by 2 again. This process is continued until the result is no longer evenly divisible by 2. 
The next step is to divide by 3 in the same manner, until the result of the division by 3 is no longer even. 
The process continues, with the divisor increasing, to 4 and so on until the result of the division is finally a prime number.<br /><br />
Although the process is clear, it is by far the least efficient, consuming a great deal of computer time compared with other methods.
The factorization of a number with two very large prime factors would take a prohibitive length of time.
Today, for the RSA process numbers in the range of 300-digit decimals or larger are used routinely.  To apply trial division (also known as a brute-force attack) in such a case would take longer than the estimated age of the universe.
