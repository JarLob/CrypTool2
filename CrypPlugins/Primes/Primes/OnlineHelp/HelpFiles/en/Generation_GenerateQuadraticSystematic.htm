<h2>Test polynomials systematically</h2>

With this dialog you can systematically generate quadratic polynomials of the form
<br />
<img src="quadratic" /><br />
and evaluate them.
The polynomials are generated by iterating through all combinations of the coefficients <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, that the specification of their intervals allow.
The interval of the independent variable x can be specified in the input field "Values for x".
