<h2>The number of prime numbers</h2>

There is no known formula for calculating the number of prime numbers up to a given natural number <strong>n</strong>.
If you want to know how many prime numbers there are up to <strong>n</strong>, you have to essentially determine for each of the numbers up to n if they are prime numbers and count the primes. The function that counts the primes is called &pi;(n).
It is a step function, which can be seen in the visualization when using small interval sizes.
<br /><br />
<strong>Hint:</strong><br />
The bigger the interval sizes get, the longer it takes to count the prime numbers and the longer it takes to draw the graph.
This is why the exact step function is only drawn up to 10,000.
Bigger values are merely counted and printed out.
