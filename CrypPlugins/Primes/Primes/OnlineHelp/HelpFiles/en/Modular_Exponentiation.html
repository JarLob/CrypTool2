<h2>Modular powers</h2>

Calculating the <strong>powers</strong> of a number in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_ring" target="_blank">residue class ring</a> is a mathematical operation that plays an important role in many cryptographic methods (e.g. RSA). The reason for this is that in a residue class ring the powers of a number can be calculated very fast and easy, whereas the inverse operation, i.e. calculating the discrete logarithm of a number, is very difficult. There are no known efficient algorithms. When the residue class ring is sufficiently big, the discrete logarithm can only be calculated with reasonable efforts, if the prime factors of the modulus are known.
