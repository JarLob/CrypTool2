<h2>Generation of a very large random number</h2>

This routine generates a random number with 100 decimal places for use in factorization. The chosen method of factorization determines the duration and the resource consumption of the process. Reasonable restraints are provided; for example, since the trial division process requires large amounts of memory and processor time, if a factor is not found after 20,000 iterations, the process is aborted.
