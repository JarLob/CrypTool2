<h2>Prime quadruplet</h2>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_quadruplet" target=_blank">prime quadruplet</a> is a pair of twin primes having a spacing of four (4) 
between the largest prime of the smaller twin and the smallest prime of the larger twin.  For example: The first prime quadruplets are (11,13,17,19), (101,103,107,109) &amp; (191,193,197,199). Thus, we note that there is a difference of 4 between 13 and 17, between 103 and 107, and between 193 and 197.

It is still unknown whether there are infinitely many prime quadruplets.  This question is one of the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics" target=_blank">Unsolved problems of mathematics</a>.
