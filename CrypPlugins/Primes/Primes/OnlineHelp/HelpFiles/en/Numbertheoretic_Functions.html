<h2>Number-theoretic functions</h2>

<strong>Number-theoretic (or arithmetic) functions</strong> are functions whose domain is the set of natural numbers and that take real or complex values.
In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory" target="_blank">number theory</a>, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory" target="_blank">number theory</a>, they are used to examine and describe the properties of natural numbers, especially with respect to their divisibility.<br />
<br />
A special type of number-theoretic functions are the <strong>multiplicative number-theoretic functions</strong>. They can be evaluated easily by using the unique factorization of a number:</br>
if n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are coprime natural numbers, then f(n<sub>1</sub>*n<sub>2</sub>) = f(n<sub>1</sub>) * f(n<sub>2</sub>).<br />
<br />
Some examples of number-theoretic functions are:
<ul>
	<li> Euler's totient function
	<li> the Möbius function
	<li> the number of divisors function
	<li> the sum of divisors function
</ul>
