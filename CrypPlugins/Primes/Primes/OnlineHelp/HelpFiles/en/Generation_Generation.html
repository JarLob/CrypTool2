<h2>Generation of primes</h2>

Prime numbers are of great importance for cryptography.
The RSA cipher for example requires two big prime numbers for the generation of its key pair.<br />
This dialog is grouped in two sections.
In the first section, you can generate as many prime numbers as you like and as big as you like.
This is done by first generating a random number and checking it and the subsequent numbers with a probabilistic prime number test, until a prime number candidate is found.<br />
The second section is devoted to the question whether a formula exists, that can generate the n-th prime number.
Here you can generate quadratic polynomials of the general form<br />

and test how many prime numbers they produce with various inputs.
