<h2>Primality test</h2>

A prime number test answers the question "Is the given number n a prime number?" with yes or no.

Such tests are often required by cryptographic methods that use prime numbers.
The RSA cryptosystem for example relies on the fact that the <a href="help://Factorization_Factorization">factorization</a> of a number into its prime factors is a very difficult mathematical problem and may take a very, very long time for big numbers.

In practise, RSA initially needs two randomly generated prime numbers with at least 300 decimal digits,
and builds a public and a secret key from them.
Therefore, one has to make sure that the two numbers are indeed prime numbers.
This is done by generating big random numbers and then using the prime number test to see
if the random number happens to be a prime number. If not, the process is repeated until a prime number is found.<br /><br />
