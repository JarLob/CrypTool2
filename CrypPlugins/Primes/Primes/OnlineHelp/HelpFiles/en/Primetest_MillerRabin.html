<h2>Miller-Rabin test</h2>

<p align="justify">
The Miller-Rabin test is the most often used primality test.
It is based on <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleiner_fermatscher_Satz" target="_blank">Fermat's Little Theorem</a>.
A very clear explanation of the procedure can be found <a href="http://www.iti.fh-flensburg.de/lang/krypto/algo/primtest.htm" target="_blank">here</a> (in German).
Because of the nature of this test, mistakes are possible: The method may produce a result which is supposedly prime, but is in fact composite.
Such numbers are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_pseudoprime" target="_blank">strong pseudoprimes</a>.
The opposite case, that the test recognizes a number as composite, which in reality is prime, doesn't happen.
