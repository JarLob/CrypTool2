<h2>The prime number theorem</h2>

At the age of 15 years, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" target="_blank">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>
formulated an assumption about the number of prime numbers up to a given natural number <strong>n</strong>.
In the appendix of a logarithm table he found a list of all prime numbers up to 1000. He counted the number of prime numbers up to 10, 100, ..., and deduced that &pi;(n)~n/ln(n), but he found no proof for this. A proof was found 100 years later by two mathematicians,
and became known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem" target="_blank">prime number theorem.</a><br />
Later, Gauss was able to improve his first approximation <a href="help://Graph_LiN">considerably</a>.
