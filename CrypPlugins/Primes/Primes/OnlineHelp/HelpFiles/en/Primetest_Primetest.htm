<h2>Primality test</h2>

A prime number test answers the question "Is the given number n a prime number?" with yes or no.

Such tests are often required by cryptographic methods that use prime numbers.
The RSA cryptosystem for example relies on the fact that the <a href="help://Factorization_Factorization">factorization</a> of a number into its prime factors is a very difficult mathematical problem and may take a very, very long time for big numbers.
RSA takes two big prime numbers with more than 150 decimal places and builds a public and a secret key from them.
For ensuring that RSA is safe, one has to make sure that the two numbers are indeed prime numbers. This is done by generating big random numbers and then using the prime number test to see if the random number happens to be a prime number. If not, the process is repeated until a prime number is found.<br /><br />
