<h2>Euler's &phi;-Function</h2>

Euler's &phi;-function is an arithmetic function. For any natural number n, the function returns a number which is the count of integers between 1 and n which are relatively prime to n.<br />
See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function" target="_blank">Euler's totient function</a><br />
<br />
The function is defined as follows:<br />

The name of the function goes back to <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler" target="_blank">Leonhard Euler</a> who first introduced it in the <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler's_theorem" target="_blank">Fermat-Euler Theorem </a> which is a generalization of
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat's_little_theorem" target="_blank">Fermat's Little Theorem</a>.

The following apply:
<ul>
<li>&phi; (n) &lt;= n-1 for all n &isin; N and</li>
<li>&phi; (n) = n-1 &hArr; n is prime.</li>
</ul>
<br />
One can therefore say that the smaller &phi; (n) is, compared to n-1, the more divisors n will have.
Conversely, &phi; (n) is considered to be an indicator of how likely it is that the natural number is prime. This likelihood is useful in primality testing, although the final determination deals with the yes/no characteristic of primality.

&phi; (n) can be calculated most easily, if the prime factorization of n is known (n = p<sub>1</sub><sup>a<sub>1</sub></sup> * ... * p<sub>k</sub><sup>a<sub>k</sub></sup>). Then

<br />
Therefore &phi; (n) = n-1, if n is a prime number.
<br />
<br />

&phi; (n) is one of the most important number-theoretic functions. The more we learn about it, the more we know about prime numbers and their distribution. Since n &isin; N is prime if and only if &phi; (n) = n-1, it follows that knowing all solutions to the equation &phi; (n) = n-1 is equivalent to knowing the sequence of prime numbers.
