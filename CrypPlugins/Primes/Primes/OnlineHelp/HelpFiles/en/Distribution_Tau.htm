<h2>Number of divisors</h2>
The Tau function indicates the number of divisors a natural number n has.  In this case the divisors 1 and n, factors for any integer, are taken into account, so that Prime numbers will have 2 factors. The function we denote by.<br />

The rule is: &tau; (p) = 2 for all primes.
This is related to the phi function: &tau; (n) + &phi; (n) = n + 1 for all n in N.
