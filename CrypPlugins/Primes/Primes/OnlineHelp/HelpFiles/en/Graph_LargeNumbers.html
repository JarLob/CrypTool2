<h2>Limits of calculating the number of prime numbers</h2>

If you enter range limits of more than one million, evaluating the number of prime numbers with the function <a href="help://Graph_PiX" >&pi;(x)</a> can take a very long time as this function calculates the exact number of primes.
For numbers bigger than one billion, also the evaluation of the <a href="help://Graph_LiN" >logarithmic integral</a> will become very slow.<br />
You can interrupt the evaluation of each of the functions by pressing the corresponding "Stop" button.
