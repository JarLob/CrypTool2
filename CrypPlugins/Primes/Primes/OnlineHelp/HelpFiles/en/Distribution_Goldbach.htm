<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach's_conjecture" target=_blank">Goldbach's conjeture</a> was formulated by the mathematician Christian Goldbach in a letter to Leonhard Euler. Many mathematicians have tried to prove or disprove the conjecture, but to date no one has achieved this.  Proof of the truth of Goldbach's conjecture is one of the great unsolved <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics" target=_blank">Problems in Mathematics</a>.
