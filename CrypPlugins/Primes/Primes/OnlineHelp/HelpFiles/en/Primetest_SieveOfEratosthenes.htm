<h2>Sieve of Eratosthenes</h2>

The sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for finding all prime numbers up to a given number.
To test if a number is prime, one determines all primes smaller than the number and
checks, if it is a multiple of any of them. The method dates back on the greek mathematician Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 200 BC).

<b>Method:</b><br />
Take the list of all numbers 1 to n.
Start with the number 2. Cross out all multiples of 2 (excluding 2 itself) on the list.
Find the next number that is not crossed out. In this case, it's the 3. Cross out all multiples of 3 (excluding 3).
Repeat this with all number that are not yet crossed out, until you reach &radic;<b><i>n</i></b>.<br />
The dialog allows you to execute the method stepwise or automatically.
In the stepwise execution, you can proceed by clicking on the corresponding number.
