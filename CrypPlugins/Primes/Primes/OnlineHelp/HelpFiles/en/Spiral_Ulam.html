<h2>Ulam's spiral</h2>

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral" target=_blank">Ulam spiral</a> is a famous method of visualizing the prime numbers.
It was discovered by the mathematician Stanis≈Çaw Ulam in 1963 during a boring presentation, when he started writing the natural numbers on a graphed paper in the shape of a spiral. He then marked all the prime numbers and to his surprise he found, that many of the prime numbers lay on
diagonals.<br />

This dialog draws the Ulam spiral. You can enter the interval of the displayed numbers and rotate and zoom the spiral with the sliding controls.
