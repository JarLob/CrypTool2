<h2>Distribution of prime numbers among the natural numbers</h2>

There are three functions which represent the distribution of primes among the natural numbers; each of the three approaches the question in a quite different way:
<ul>
<li>
  <a href="help://Distribution_Numberline">Distribution on the number line</a>
</li>
<li>
  <a href="help://Distribution_Numbergrid">Distribution within the number grid</a>
</li>
<li>
  <a href="help://Spiral_Ulam">Distribution in the Ulam spiral</a>
</li>
</ul>
