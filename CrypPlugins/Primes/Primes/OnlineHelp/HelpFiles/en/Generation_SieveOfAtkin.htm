<h2>Sieve of Atkin</h2>

The sieve of Atkin was developed by the mathematician A.O.L Atkin in 2004.
His method finds all prime numbers up to a given limit and is an optimization
of the <a href="help://Primetest_SieveOfEratosthenes" >Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>.
It makes use of certain modular congruences to detect a prime number.
<br />
<br />
This dialog generates a list of all numbers up to the given limit and marks them all as "nonprime" in the beginning.
In the course of the algorithm, the state of each number can change multiple times between "prime" and "nonprime", depending on the evaluated congruences.

The algorithm is described in more detail <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin" target="_blank">here</a>.
