<h2>Pari/GP for the evaluation of the logarithmic integral</h2>

Pari/Gp is an Open Source <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system" target="_blank">Computer Algebra System (CAS)</a>,
that offers very fast implementations of arithmetic functions.<br />
It evaluates the logarithmic integral with much more precision than using Simpson's rule.<br />
Pari/Gp can be downloaded from the <a href="http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/"target="_blank">webite of the University of Bordeaux</a>.
<br />
Activate the checkbox "Pari/GP" for using Pari for the evaluation of the logarithmic integral and select the program "gp.exe" in the file dialog. The program is in the Pari/GP installation folder.
