  <introduction lang="en">The LFSR component implements the functionality of a linear feedback shift register. Given a polynomial and a seed, it computes as many output bits as set in the settings of the plugin. Additionally the plugin displays a visual live representation of the LFSR in its presentation. Moreover the plugin can be stepped by an external clock.
To get a specific internal stage the LFSR plugin also provides an additional output bit. The stage is marked orange in the 
presentation. If all stages are needed, the plugin is able to provide a boolean array that outputs the complete state of an LFSR.<newline />
