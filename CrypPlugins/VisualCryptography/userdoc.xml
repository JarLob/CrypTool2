  <introduction lang="en">
    Visual cryptography is a method of encryption which allows to encrypt data (e.g. text and images) in such a way that the decrypted information appears as a visual image.<newline/><newline/>
    The first visual encryption algorithm was invented by Moni Naor und Adi Shamir in 1994 <ref id="NaorShamir"/><ref id="wikipedia"/>. It is a visual secret sharing method, where a plaintext image is divided into n ciphertext images.
    An arbitrary subset of ciphertext images of size n - 1 is not enough to reveal the plaintext image.
    Each ciphertext image is printed on a transparent plastic sheet. To reveal the plaintext image, all ciphertext images have to be put on top of each other.

  <usage lang="en">
    The Visual Cryptography component encrypts a given text and creates two ciphertext images (image 1 and image 2), which need to be combined for decryption. The basic algorithm here is based on the idea of Naor and Shamir <ref id="NaorShamir"/><ref id="wikipedia"/>. <newline/>
    <newline/>
    For encryption, a font that supports ASCII characters is used internally. First, an internal image is generated which contains the plaintext as image.
    Then, the internal image is encrypted using a random key stream of bits generated by a cryptographic secure random number generator (a .net RNGCryptoServiceProvider).
    For encryption two new ciphertext images are created. Each pixel of the original image is encrypted in both ciphertext images by four pixel patterns.
    The patterns are chosen based on the randomly generated bits of the random number generator.
    Following are the pixel patterns (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal):<newline/>

    <newline/>
    To encrypt a white pixel of the original image in the ciphertext images, the same pattern is used in the ciphertext images.
    In the following, the combinations to create white pixels is shown:	<newline/>

    To encrypt a black pixel of the original image in the ciphertext images, inverse patterns are used in the ciphertext images.
    In the following, the combinations to create white pixels is shown:	<newline/>
    <img src="VisualCryptography/images/black_combinations.png" /><newline/>
    <newline/>
    The Visual Cryptography component allows the usage of all above shown patterns in any combinations. To change the to be used patterns, the component's setting "Visual pattern" has to be changed.<newline/>
    <newline/>
    The setting "Characters per row" allows to define how many characters in the plaintext image will be printed in a text row.

    The Visual Cryptography component's visualization allows to shift bot ciphertext images on top of each other. When both images are perfectly aligned on top of each other, the plaintext image is revealed.
