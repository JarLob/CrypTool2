This is a modified version of msieve-1.42 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/msieve),
which can be used in .NET.


To compile this, you first have to compile mpir (MPIR is an 
open source multiprecision integer library derived from version 4.2.1 
of the GMP (GNU Multi Precision) project).

We recommend using mpir-1.2.1.
