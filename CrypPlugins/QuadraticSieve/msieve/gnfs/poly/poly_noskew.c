/* Polynomial generator for the number field sieve.
   The following generates non-skewed polynomials, and does
   not attempt to optimize them.

   Note that just covering the search space of candidate
   polynomials efficiently is a very interesting problem. The
   ideal solution
   	- covers as much of the space as possible
	- as fast as possible
	- without performing redundant work
	- and covers a broad range of polynomials early on
	- while allowing faster CPUs to explore more of the space
	- in a way that parallelizes easily

   The current implementation does all of these, though it is
   not set up to run in parallel. Hopefully some of the techniques
   used can be applied to skewed polynomials */
