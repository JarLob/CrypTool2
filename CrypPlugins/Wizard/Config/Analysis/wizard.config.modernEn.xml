      <description lang="en" >In cryptography, RSA (which stands for Rivest, Shamir and Adleman who first publicly described it) is an algorithm for public-key cryptography.[1] It is the first algorithm known to be suitable for signing as well as encryption, and was one of the first great advances in public key cryptography. RSA is widely used in electronic commerce protocols, and is believed to be secure given sufficiently long keys and the use of up-to-date implementations.</description>

          The security of the RSA cryptosystem is based on the problem of factoring large integer numbers, because of the relation N = p*q.
          N is known and p and q are needed to easily calculate the private key "d".
          So by clicking "next", you can factorize a large number into all its factors.
