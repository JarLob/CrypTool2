    This component provides different comparators for two inputs. The success of this operation depends on the comparability of
    the given inputs. If possible, the types will be cast automatically (from one object type to a compatible one) and compared afterwards.
    Otherwise, an error will be shown.<newline/>
    <newline/>
    Hint: A "String" and a "CryptoolStream" will be compared using their binary representaion.

  <usage lang="en">
    To use the comparator component, the user has to put it onto the workspace. Both inputs have to be connected with compatible types (for example
    two Strings or a String and a CryptoolStream). The output of the comparison is a boolean value which is true, if the comparison succeeded and
    false, if it failed<newline/>
    <newline/>
    Within the settings of the component, the user may choose which comparison method/operator shall be used:<newline/>
    <newline/>
    == The comparison is true if both given inputs are equal.<newline/>
    <newline/>
    != The comparison is true if both given inputs are unequal.<newline/>
    <newline/>
    &gt; The comparison is true if the first input is greater than the second one ("Greater" depends on the input type).<newline/>
    <newline/>
    &lt; The comparison is true if the first input is smaller than the second one ("Smaller" depends on the input type).<newline/>
    <newline/>
    &gt;= The comparison is true if the first input is greater or equal than the second one ("Greater" depends on the input type).<newline/>
    <newline/>
    &lt;= The comparison is true if the first input is smaller or equal than the second one ("Smaller" depends on the input type).<newline/>
