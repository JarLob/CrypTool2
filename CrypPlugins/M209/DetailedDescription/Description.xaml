        <Span xml:lang="en-gb">In cryptography, the M-209, designated CSP-1500 by the Navy (C-38 by the manufacturer) is a portable, mechanical cipher machine used by the US military primarily in World War II, though it remained in active use through the Korean War. The M-209 was designed by Swedish cryptographer Boris Hagelin in response to a request for such a portable cipher machine, and was an improvement of an earlier machine, the C-36.

The M-209 is about the size of a lunchbox, in its final form measuring 3.25 by 5.5 by 7 inches (83 by 140 by 178 mm). It represented a brilliant achievement for pre-electronic technology. It used a wheel scheme similar to that of a telecipher machine, such as the Lorenz cypher and the Geheimfernschreiber.</Span>

        <Span xml:lang="en-gb">The Caesar encryption algorithm uses one character from the alphabet as key. Depending on the position of this key letter, the letters of the plaintext are shifted in repeated cycles. If the alphabet consists only of upper case letters (this is the default case), a cyclical shift of one character takes place when "B" is entered, two characters for "C", ... and 25 characters for "Z". To decrypt the text, each encrypted letter is simply shifted in the other direction.</Span>

Rot-13 uses the 26-upper-case-letter alphabet, shifts each character by 13 places (corresponding to a Caesar encryption with key "N") and all non-alphabet letters are kept. A repeated Rot-13 operation yields the plain text again.</Span>
