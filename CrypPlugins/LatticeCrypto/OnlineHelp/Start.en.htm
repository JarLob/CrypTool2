        Lattice-based cryptography</h2>
    <p align="justify">
        In this crypto tutorial you will learn about lattices and their use in cryptography 
        especially cryptanalysis. This introduction is intended to provide the basics, 
        to better understand the following chapters.
    </p>
     <p>
        <strong>Lattices</strong></br> A lattice consists of linearly independent vectors that are linearly combined with each other and thereby generate lattice points. 
         The difference between lattices and a &quot;normal&quot; vector space is the fact that the 
         vectors are multiplied with integer factors instead of real factors.</br>
         All the vectors form a so called basis for the lattice. This basis can be written in the form of a matrix. The vectors can be written down in column notation, this is the most common way in papers. The vectors define so-called parallelepipeds, in the two-dimensional case these are parallelograms.
        The volume of this parallelepiped is equal to the absolute value of the determinant.
        </br></br>
        Please note that in this crypto tutorial all values ​​are integers, 
         since big integers are common in modern cryptography. This however is not a 
         requirement for lattices itself, but only for the factors multiplied with the 
         vectors. The benefit of this limitation will arise in the later chapters "Merkle-Hellman" and "RSA".
     </p>
     <p>
        <strong>Lattice problems</strong></br> An important characteristic of lattices is 
         the fact that they
can have different bases producing the same lattice. The determinants of all these bases 
         have the same value. Regarding lattices, vectors with minimum length are 
         interesting. The problem to find these vectors is called the Shortest Vector 
         Problem (SVP) and relates to the search for "successive minima".</br>The first minimum is the shortest vector. All other vectors are linearly independent to this and to each other, they are 
         also as short as possible. 
        An upper bound for the shortest vector is determined by the Hermite constant. The shortest vector is also interesting for the packing density of a lattice. Here circles are constructed around each
Lattice point being as large as possible without overlapping each other 
        (both the Hermite circuit and the package circuits can be enabled in the settings).
        It can be easily observed that after reduction the vectors are very much orthogonal to each other, ideally they even have the angle of 90 °.</br>
         Another interesting problem is the Closest Vector Problem (CVP). Here an 
         arbitrary point is specified and then we search for a lattice point which is 
         closest to this arbitrary point. 
     </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Lattice reduction</strong></br> 
        There are two important methods that implement the search for shortest vectors. One of these is the Gaussian algorithm for dimension 2 and secondly the LLL algorithm, named after Arjen Lenstra, Hendrik Lenstra and László Lovász, for an arbitrary lattice dimension.
        The Gaussian algorithm works similar to the Euclidean algorithm for searching 
        the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers. By combining and subtracting of two vectors the basis&nbsp;improves after each iteration with a shorter vector. 
        The LLL algorithm works similar to the Gauss algorithm, but for higher 
        dimensions it produces only an approximation to the shortest vector. An 
        important part of the algorithm is the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.</p>
