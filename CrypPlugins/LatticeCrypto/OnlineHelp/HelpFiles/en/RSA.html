<h2>RSA-Cryptosystem</h2>
<p>
    The RSA method, see [RSA78], is based on the problem of prime factorization. On 
    one side it is easy to multiply two large prime numbers with each other, thereby 
    obtaining an RSA modulus. On the other hand it is difficult to break down any 
    large biprime number into its two unknown large prime factors. It is therefore 
    believed that this is a trap door function. The RSA method makes use of this 
    problem and sets the difficulty in the factorization of the modulus n, which 
    consists of two large prime numbers p and q.</p>
<p>It is calculated: n = pq.</p>
<p>
    The public key and the private key are calculated by using the numbers e and d, 
    for which ed = 1 mod phi(n). The Euler phi function counts how many positive integers less than or equal to n are there that are relatively prime to n. For prime numbers is phi(p) = p - 1.</p>
    <p>
        Besides the condition ed = 1 mod phi (n) the number e can be chosen freely, 
        however the number should be used in such a way that the encryption is designed 
        efficiently. To determine the multiplicative inverse d of the chosen number e 
        the extended Euclidean algorithm can be used.</p>
<p>Following calculation is performed in order to encrypt a plaintext m into a 
    ciphertext c: c = m^e mod n.</p>
<p>For decryption the inverse calculation applies: m = c^d mod n.</p>
<p>
    The message m must be a positive integer between 0 and n - 1 -- due to the modulo n calculation. The ciphertext c is thus also between 0 and n - 1. The RSA 
    method is therefore a block cipher. Larger plaintexts must be split before 
    encryption into blocks of length &lt; log2 (n).</p>

        <p>
            For RSA there are similar lattice attacks, described among others by Johan 
            Håstad, Don Coppersmith and Nick Howgrave-Graham. However, a very small exponent 
            e must be used. From Coppersmith and Graham exists an attack on 
            stereotyped messages. Such a message could begin with: &quot;The new password is: 
            ****&quot;. If the attacker knows the first part and the public key is very small, he 
            can easily calculate the unknown part, as long as it is not too large.</p>
