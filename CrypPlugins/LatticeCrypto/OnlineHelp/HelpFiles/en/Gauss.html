<h2>Gauss algorithm</h2>
<p>
    In a lattice in two-dimensional space the Gaussian algorithm finds reliably a 
    shortest vector. It works similar to the Euclidean algorithm for the greatest 
    common divisor gcd of two integers, because after each step, the basis improves 
    by a shorter vector. In this case the longer vector b2 is iteratively subtracted 
    by an integer multiple of the shorter vector b1. The subtrahend is the component 
    of b2 which points in the direction of b1 (see figure). With this operation the linear 
    independence is maintained. After the substraction b2 gets smaller and so does 
    ||b1|| * ||b2||. Since there is an finite number of lattice points the 
    algorithm terminates in any case.</p>

    <p>The angle between the two vectors is at the end between 60° and 120°. One can easily see that a reduced basis approximates the 90° angle.</p>
