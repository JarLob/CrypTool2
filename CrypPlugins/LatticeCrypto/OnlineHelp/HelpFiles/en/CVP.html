<h2>Closest Vector Problem</h2>
<p>
    
The Closest Vector Problem is beside the
    <a href="help://SVP">Shortest Vector Problem</a> an&nbsp; interesting problem 
    associated with lattices. <span id="result_box" class="" lang="en">
    <span class="hps">A <a href="help://TargetPoint">target point</a></span>
    <span class="hps alt-edited">given</span><span class="">, which is located</span>
    <span class="hps">within the</span> <span class="hps">vector space</span><span>, 
    but</span> <span class="hps">does not necessarily have</span> <span class="hps">
    to be</span> <span class="hps">a lattice</span> <span class="hps">point itself</span></span>. 
    CVP is looking for a lattice point, which is close to this point.
    <span id="result_box0" class="" lang="en"><span class="hps alt-edited">This 
    means</span> <span class="hps">the</span> distance of both points has<span 
        class="hps"> to be</span> <span class="hps">minimal.</span></span></p>
    <pThis is interesting for example in connection with the GGH Cryptosystem, which 
        places its safety in dissolving the CVP.</p>
