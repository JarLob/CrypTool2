<h2>Lattice determinant</h2>
<p>
    The vectors of the basis create a parallelepiped P (a parallelogram in two-dimensional space). This is the fundamental domain of the lattice and is defined as follows:</p>

<p>The lattice determinant is the volume of the parallelepiped and can also be understood as the absolute value of the determinant of the basis matrix.:</p>

<p>The lattice determinat is independent of the choice of the basis, therefore it is well-defined and is called a invariant.</p>

<p>Compare the non-reduced basis with the reduced basis. Both have the same lattice determinat. In the following diagram, the two shaded areas are equal of size.</p>
