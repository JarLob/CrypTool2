<h2>Merkle-Hellman-Cryptosystem</h2>
<p>
    The Merkle-Hellman-Cryptosystem (named after Ralph Merkle and Martin Hellman) 
    was created in 1987 next to the RSA cryptosystem as one of the first asymmetric 
    cryptosystems at all. It was characterized by the fact that it is relatively 
    easy to understand. Of these two, however, only RSA prevailed since 
    Merkle-Hellman soon was impressively broken using lattices.</p>
<p>The Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem is based on the knapsack problem, more precisely, 
    the partial sum problem. Given a set N of objects wj with the respective weight 
    and a capacity constraint c. The aim is as in the general knapsack problem a 
    maximization. The Merkle-Hellman cryptosystem is based on the partial sum 
    problem, but requires an additional constraint, the result must correspond to 
    the exact weight c. The knapsack problem belongs to the NP-complete problems.</p>
<p>The knapsack problem can easily be illustrated with an example: Suppose a thief 
    breaks at night into a shop and sees various valuables left on the shelves. His 
    backpack carries only limited weight. Since he wants to maximize the total value 
    of his stolen goods and would like to make his backpack full he must consider 
    thoroughly 
    what items he actually takes.</p>
<p>
    Idea of the cryptosystem: The private key is a superincreasing 
    set of weights. For the owner of this key it is very easy to solve the partial 
    sum problem for a certain capacity size, because he just has to check the 
    weights one after the other in descending order by size weights. To transform 
    the simple knapsack problem into a heavy knapsack problem, two large numbers q and w are 
    generated with gcd (q, w) = 1. Further, there must be a number k such that k * w = 
    1 mod q. This guarantees a multiplicative inverse for w which is needed for the 
    decryption. This heavy knapsack problem is the public key.</p>
<p>For the attack a square lattice matrix is set up and reduced with LLL:</p>
