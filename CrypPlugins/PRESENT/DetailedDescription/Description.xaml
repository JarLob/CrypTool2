      PRESENT is an example of an SP-network and consists of 31 rounds. The block length is 64 bits and two key lengths of 80 and 128 bits are supported. PRESENT is an ultra-lightweight block cipher, designed to work in extremely constrained environments such as RFID tags and sensor networks with both security and hardware efficiency in mind.
