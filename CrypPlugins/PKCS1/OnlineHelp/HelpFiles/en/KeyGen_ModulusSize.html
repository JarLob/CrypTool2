<h2>RSA modulus</h2>

The modulus is part of the public and the private RSA keys.</br>

For the present attacks on the PKCS#1 signatures only the bit size of the modulus is required, not the value of the modulus itself. You can enter the bit size in this tab.
The default bit size of the modulus for the Bleichenbacher attack is 3072 bits. For attacks that use shorter keys the key size can be adapted in this tab.
