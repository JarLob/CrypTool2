<h2>Public RSA key</h2>

The public key of the RSA key pair is used to validate a signature that was generated with the private RSA key.

The validation can be performed very efficiently if the Hamming weight of the public key is low. This is the case if the public key is for example 3, 17 or 65537.
A prerequisite for the Bleichenbacher attack is that the public key equals 3.
