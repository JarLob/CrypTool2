<h2>Bleichenbacher attack</h2>

To generate a faked signature we first create the <a href="help://Gen_Datablock_Tab">data block</a> as we would for a regular PKCS#1 signature. The <a href="help://Gen_Bleichenb_Sig_Tab">structure</a> of the faked signature differs from the regular signature in the following points:
 <ul>
 <li>The padding string is shortened. Thus the <a href="help://Gen_Datablock_Tab">data block</a> is shifted further to the left in the signature. This is not recognized by faulty implementations of the signature validation algorithm.
The amount of the shift can be varied.</li>
 <li>The unused space at the end of the signature is filled with random data, the so called 'garbage'.</li>
 </ul>
</br></br>
<strong>Please notice that in order to carry out the Bleichenbacher attack you first have to create an RSA key pair and the data block in the corresponding mask.</strong></br>
