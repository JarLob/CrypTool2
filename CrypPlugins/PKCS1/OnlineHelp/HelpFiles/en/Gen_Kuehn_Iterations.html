<h2>Maximum number of iterations</h2>

In this field you can specify the maximum number of iterations for the algorithm before it is interrupted.
If it finds a result the algorithm stops and the result is displayed.</br>
The algorithm should find a solution after 131.072 iterations on average (if SHA-1 is selected as hash algorithm).
