	<h2>Attacks on PKCS#1 signatures (Bleichenbacher and Kuehn)</h2>
	<p align="justify">
	PKCS#1 signatures are based on the RSA encryption scheme.
	The attack devised by Daniel Bleichenbacher does not attack the encryption scheme, but flawed implementations of the signature 
	validation that were present in several RSA class libraries.
	The attack was published in 2006.
	Since then the signature specifications and the affected libraries have been corrected.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<strong>Digital signatures</strong></br>
	Digital signatures are used to check the authenticity of a digital message or to guarantee the identity of the sender.
	Signatures are based on asymmetrical encryption schemes (in this case RSA), that use a public and a private key.
	</br></br>
	To generate a signature of a message it is not necessary to encrypt the complete message with the private key.
	Instead, a hash value of the message is calculated. Together with some other informations this hash value is then formatted
	in a special way (as described by the PKCS specifications). Only this formatted data block is then encrypted with the
	private key.</br>
	The digital message is then transfered to the receiver together with the resulting signature.
	The receiver can now validate the authenticity of the data by first decrypting the signature with the
	public key of the sender. From the decrypted signature the sender can read the used hash function and the
	corresponding hash value of the original message. Now the sender can himself calculate the hash value of
	the original message and compare it to the hash value in the signature. If they are equal, the message
	is regarded as authentic.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	<strong>Bleichenbacher attack</strong></br>
	The Bleichenbacher attack allows, under certain circumstances, to forge a signature.
	If the signature validation process is implemented according to PKCS#1 version 1.5, such a forged signature
	is accepted as valid.
	This attack is not applicable against implementations that comply to the revised specification PKCS#1 version 2.1.</br>
	</p>
  <p align="justify">
  <strong>Attack with shorter keys (Kuehn attack)</strong></br>
  In contrast to the Bleichenbacher attack (key lengths of 3072 bits) the Kuehn attack aims at shorter keys (1024 bits).
  Instead of explicitly calculating a forged signature the Kuehn attack tries to find a valid signature by manipulating the message.
  Thus it heavily relies on computing power.</br>
