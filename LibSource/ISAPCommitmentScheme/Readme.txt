This C++/CLI project is a wrapper around the Bit Commitment Scheme code by Martin Schmidt.
The original source can be found at his website:
http://www.ifam.uni-hannover.de/~mschmidt/

To compile this project, you need Visual Studio 2019.
The libraries MPIR and MPFR in subdirectories "../mpir" and "../mpfr" need to be compiled first. 
See the information files "README.CT2" in these directories for more information.

After successful compilation of these libraries, the solution "ISAPCommitmentScheme.sln" can be compiled as well.
