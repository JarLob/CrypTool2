The symbol in the selection is compared with the entire image and a cross-correlation coefficient is calculated for each section. A perfect match is 100%, and absolutely no match 0%. With the threshold you can set a value from which a symbol is to be accepted. Symbols that were not found can be added by double clicking on its icon in the list. In this mode the order in which the symbols are marked doesn't matter. After all symbols are marked you have to click on the &quot;1st symbol&quot; button and click on the first symbol in each row. This can also be made undone by clicking on a rectangle that is already highlighted."/>
