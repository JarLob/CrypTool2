Task 1:
-------
In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, theshift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplestand most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type ofsubstitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext isreplaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down thealphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replacedby A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after JuliusCaesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

Task 3:
-------
In cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm for performing encryptionor decryption -- a series of well-defined steps that can be followedas a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. Toencipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. Incommon parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "code," as they areboth a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the conceptsare distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.

Task 4:
-------
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.

Task 6:
-------
For the AES the National Institute of Standards and Technology selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
