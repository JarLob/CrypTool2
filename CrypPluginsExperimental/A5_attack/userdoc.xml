  <introduction lang="en">
    A5/1 is a modern stream cipher that provides privacy for the GSM mobile phone system.
    It consists of three linear shift registers (LFSR) that are mixed with the secret key and the IV (initialization vector),
    in order to provide the keystream, which is later being XORed with the plaintext to give the ciphertext.
    The attack against this cipher takes into consideration all the cases when 2 or 3 feedback shift registers contain all zero values after
    the initialization process.
    In such cases, the keystream generated will be constant, consisting entirely of zeros (the case when the message sent is the clear text)
    or of entirely ones (the case when the message sent is the complement of the plaintext). 
    This is not a desirable result, meaning that such scenario proves that we are dealing with a weak loaded state.

  <usage lang="en">

    After dragging the A5/1 attack component into the workspace, you need to attach two text input components that correspond: 
    1. to the original secret key (which will be used for matching the key bits generated by equations that bring together the IV and/or guessed bits) 
    and 
    2. the IV.
    
    Then you have to connect 2 text output component to "output" connectors. One of them will indicate the found secret key and the other will indicate
    the case and the corresponding guessed free bits.
    The original secret key must be 64 characters and the IV must be 22 characters.
