    Grain v1 is a symmetric stream cipher which is based on two shift registers and a non-linear output function. 
    The key size is 80 bits and the size of the initialization vector is 64 bits.
    According to the attack, we need to set the internal state of the LFSR in the final clock to zero state and then select NFSR randomly.
    Then in reverse we compute the keystream, LFSR, NFSR.
    Attack terminates if the LFSR bits in positions 64 to 79 are always 1.

  <usage lang="en">
    After dragging the GrainV1Attack component onto your workspace, you will have to attach the connectors 'Input' and 'IV' to data sources.
    After that you have to connect a text output component to the 'Output' connector.
