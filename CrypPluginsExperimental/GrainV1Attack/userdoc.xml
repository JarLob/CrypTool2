    Grain v1 is a symmetric stream cipher which is based on two shift registers and a non-linear output function. 
    The key size is 80 bits and the size of the initialization vector is 64 bits.
    According to the attack, we need to set the internal state of the LFSR in the final clock to zero state and then select NFSR randomly.
    Then in reverse we compute the keystream, LFSR, NFSR.
    Attack terminates if the LFSR bits in positions 64 to 79 are 1.
    The same attack algorithm is applied to Grain v0 cipher as well; the difference between these two ciphers is in the terms of the variables
    in equations that define the NFSR and the filter function (the function that defines the LFSR is the same for both of the ciphers).

  <usage lang="en">
    After dragging the GrainV1Attack component onto your workspace, you will have to attach a "Random Generator" to data sources, which is used to
    generate the NFSR in the final clocking randomly. 
    
    Then you have to connect three text output components to the 'Output' connectors, which correspond to: the LFSR at the initial state, 
    NFSR at the initial state, and NFSR in the 160th clocking.
    NFSR bits in the output component indicate the secret key.
    LFSR bits from positions 0 to 63 in the output component indicate the IV.
