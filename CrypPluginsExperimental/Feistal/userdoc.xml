    Feistel cipher (also commonly known as a Feistel network) is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers.
    The Feistel structure has the advantage that encryption and decryption operations are very similar, even identical in some cases, requiring only a reversal of the key schedule.
    Therefore, the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved.
    A Feistel network is an iterated cipher with an internal function called the Round function which operates on half of the input and a key.

  <usage lang="en">
    The plugin for Feistel cipher is fairly simple to use. It takes three inputs; the plain text, the key and an integer value for number of rounds.
    After providing the necessary inputs and running the plugin, the output is the cipher text produced by the Feistel network.
