  <introduction lang="en">The Solitaire Cipher was designed by Bruce Schneier upon request by Neal Stephenson. It appears as 'Pontifex' (to hide that it
 
employs a deck of cards) in Stephenson's book <i>Cryptonomicon</i>. <newline />
Schneier says he "designed it to allow field agents to communicate securely without having to rely on electronics or having to carry incriminating tools". For a detailed description of the cipher see Schneier's website http://www.schneier.com/solitaire.html.

  <usage lang="en">To encrypt with Solitaire, you need a deck of cards with 2 jokers. Not all other cards are needed, anything from 1 card up to all 52 works, only the 2 jokers are required. Hence, in the plugin one can choose the amount of cards. <newline />
If you want to decrypt a message, it is important that the same amount of cards is chosen as was used to encrypt the message. Otherwise, the decryption will be incorrect.<newline />
You can choose how the initial deck is generated:<newline />
-Ascending<newline />
-Descending<newline />
-Given state<newline />
-Password<newline />
-Random<newline /><newline />
Ascending, descending and random speak for themselves, where ascending order of colors is Spades - Hearts - Diamonds - Clovers, ascending order of cards is 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.<newline /> 
For Given state, it is required to input the order of cards as numbers separated by commas, e.g. 1,2,3,4 will become 2 and 3 of spades followed by joker 1 and joker 2. <newline />
The initial deck can also be created by using a password. See Schneier's website (http://www.schneier.com/solitaire.html) for details on how this is done. <newline />
The input text is padded with X until the length is a multiple of 5. Then a cipher stream is created with the same length as the padded input text, which is ultimately 'added' to the input text (modulo 26).<newline />
Generation of the cipher stream can be done automatically for speed and manually to see exactly what happens.

  <presentation lang="en">If manual cipher stream generation is chosen, the presentation must be used. When the workspace is executed, the presentation button "Initialize" will be enabled. This will create the initial deck using the option given in the settings.<newline />
After that, the user can go through the 5 steps as described on Schneier's website (http://www.schneier.com/solitaire.html). After each step, the deck will be updated and the cards that have changed position are displayed in bold font. <newline />
Each series of five steps generates a single cipher character. The same amount as characters in the input text must be generated to perform encryption or decryption. If all steps are clear, the user can chose to generated the remaining characters automatically by clicking this button.
