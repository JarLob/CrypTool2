This Visual Decoder is a fork of the original decoder. It contains an OCR-decoder, which may cause memory leaks.

 this fork has been comitted into the experimental folder.

  <startup useLegacyV2RuntimeActivationPolicy="true">
    <legacyCorruptedStateExceptionsPolicy enabled="true"/>
	<supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.0"/>
  </startup>
