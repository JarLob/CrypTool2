  <introduction lang="en">  
        Due to the simplicity of its key schedule, using the same 8 key bytes in each round, Treyfer was one of the first ciphers shown to be susceptible to a slide attack. 
        This cryptanalysis, which is independent of the number of rounds and the choice of S-box, requires 2^32 known plaintexts and 2^44 computation time.

  <usage lang="en">
      The slide attack on Treyfer in CrypTool2 takes two character inputs of lenght 8 each. 
      These inputs represent a slid pair. Searching of slid pair is not included as part of the attack as this involves a huge number of inputs to be examined and searched. 
      Once the slid pais is provided, the attack performes its operations and retrieves the key in the output field.
