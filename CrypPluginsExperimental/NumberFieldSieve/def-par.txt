# These are default parameters for different size factorizations.
# They will be used only to fill in any non-user-supplied parameters.
# At the moment, they surely will not be optimal - they are just
# my best guess. Once we've gathered more data from succesful factorizations
# we will be able to fill them in more accurately.
# The format of the file is as follows:
#
# type,digits,deg,maxs1,maxskew,goodScore,efrac,j0,j1,eStepSize, 
#       maxTime,rlim,alim,lpbr,lpba,mfbr,mfba,rlambda,alambda,qintsize,A,B

# 4/10/05: Note that the last two fields are new; these specify a default classical
# sieve range, for (a,b)\in [-A,A]x[1,B].
# The values that are here are just a random choice for now; at some point,
# somebody should do some experimentation at various levels to decide on
# more reasonable choices.
###########################################################################
#
# Of course, for SNFS numbers, the values deg through maxTime are ignored,
# since these are used only for polynomial selection. Also note that for
# SNFS numbers, the 'digits' is the SNFS difficulty. For example, if you're
# factoring a c110 divisor of 10^130-1, the SNFS difficulty is 130 since
# you could essentially factor a special 130 with the same parameters (i.e.,
# most obviously, the 'm' will be the same size as for a special 130).
# Finally: note that some of these numbers are pure guesses - I grabbed
# some of them from factorizations with earlier versions of GGNFS for which
# lambda values were limited to < 2.0, but tried to make a reasonable
# guess at what might be good. I am currently running a large number of tests
# to get some good figures for the polynomial selection numbers.
# Note: The 'qintsize' figures have apparent drop-offs and places where the
# 13I siever kicks in instead of the 12I siever, because the 13I spends more
# time on each 'q' value than the 12I does. There will also be another dropoff
# where the 14I kicks in.
