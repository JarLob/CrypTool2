  <introduction lang="en">
    Grøstl is one of the five finalist of the NIST SHA-3 Competition. It is an iterated hash function where the compression
    function is built from two fixed, large, different permutations. The design of the permutations was inspired by AES,
    meaning that their design consists of a number of rounds and each round consists of a number of round transformations.

  <usage lang="en">
    The Grøstl component has one input and one output. <i>Input Stream</i> is mandatory and connects to the data to be hashed.
    In the component settings you can pick the variant of the Grøstl hash function you want to use (<i>Grøstl-224</i>,
    <i>Grøstl-256</i>, <i>Grøstl-384</i>, <i>Grøstl-512</i>).
