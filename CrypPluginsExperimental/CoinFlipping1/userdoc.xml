  <introduction lang="en">    
  There are two people, Alice and Bob. They are talking on telephone and they argue about something. So they agree that Bob will name a value(head or tail) and Alice will flip a coin. If Bob will name it right, he wins. Otherwise Alice wins. Problem is that Alice can easily cheats. This situation solves Coin Flipping Protocol.
 
  This is original concept of this protocol: 
  Alice will flip a coin and she will send encrypted result by one way function. Bob sends his tip. Alice will determine winner and to make sure that she will not cheat, she will send that on way function to the bob. 
  
  Because sending functions through output is unpractical. Alice will send key to the one way function instead.
