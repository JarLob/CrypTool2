    This component is the implementation of the VIC Cipher.
    <newline/>
    This component uses the original enciphering algorithm used by the Soviet agent Reino Häyhänen in the 1950s.
    It uses 1 substitution and 2 transpositions and the tables are composed using a 5-part key. 
    This component also brings the latin alphabet support to VIC cipher.
