  <introduction lang="en">    
    A5/1 is a modern stream cipher that provides privacy for the GSM mobile phone system. 
    It consists of three linear shift registers (LFSR) that are mixed with the secret key and the IV (initialization vector),
    in order to provide the keystream, which is later being XORed with the plaintext to give the ciphertext.

  <usage lang="en">
    
  After dragging the A5/1 component into the workspace, you need to attach the three text input components that correspond to
  secret key, IV and plaintext to data sources. 
  Then you have to connect a text output component to the "output" connector.
  Message length must be 28 characters, the secret key must be 64 characters and the IV must be 22 characters.
