  <introduction lang="en">
    This component splits an input binary stream into two streams. This can be useful when working with composite streams formed by contactenating multiple fields.
    For example, a message concatenated with a digital signature. In addition, complex PDUs can be constructed using the Concatenate component <docRef item="Cryptool.Plugins.Concatenate"/> 
    and subsequently deconstructed by using this component to test protocols with arbitrary complexity.

  <usage lang="en">
    Connect the input stream into the component's InputStream input. The offset can be defined in the component Settings or provided as an input to the Offset input for more flexibility. <newline/>
    There are two outputs, OutputStream1 and OutputStream2. After the execution is completed, OutputStream1 contains the bytes from the start of the InputStream to just before Offset, 
    while OutputStream2 contains the bytes from Offset to the end of the InputStream. <newline/>
    If it is desired to split the input stream from the end, the Offset value should be negative. For example, if you want OutputStream2 to contain the last 10 bytes of the InputStream,
    then set the Offset value to -10.
